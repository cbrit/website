##Hi. 
I'm Collin. I'm a guy in my twenties who recently (less than a year ago) accidentally dipped his toes into the field of DevOps engineering. ADD STUFF HERE. I've been hooked ever since.

###I am learning every day
but really have nothing to show for it pubically since all of my work is behind my company's private network. I've decided to start a personal project that will allow me to show what I've learned in the last year and give me an opportunity to grow particularly in the areas of contuous integration/deployment, containerization with Docker, security, web development, and networking. Most importantly, I want to apply proven methodoligies such as test driven development and continuous integration and deployment.

###cbrittain.com!
This website is the project. I'll be posting updates as I go about the changes I make and what I learn. To start, I want to create a basic web page that shows this introductory blurb, serve it with Go (just because), containerize it with Docker, and host it in AWS at cbrittain.com. Here goes nothin'.
